#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to

#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:

#   * Working directory reporting so new tabs, splits inherit the

#     for confirmation.
#
#   * Resizing the window with a complex prompt usually paints much
#     better.
#

#
#   * `none` - Do not do any automatic injection. You can still manually
#     configure your shell to enable the integration.
#
#   * `detect` - Detect the shell based on the filename.

#
#   * `cursor` - Set the cursor to a blinking bar at the prompt.

#
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
#
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.

# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
